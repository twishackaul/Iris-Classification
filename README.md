# Iris-Classification
#### Developed a traditional Artificial Neural Network model for classificaton of flower specied in Iris Dataset. Confusion Matrix and Heatmap is used for performance evaluation with performance metrics used during training as Accuracy. 
#### The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set.
#### The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris:
* Iris setosa
* Iris virginica 
* Iris versicolor)
#### Four features were measured from each sample: 
* The length
* The width of
* The sepals and petals
#### Based on the combination of these four features,  a linear discriminant model was developed to distinguish the species from each other.
